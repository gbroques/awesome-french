## Consonants

The 3 new consonants sounds for English speakers in French are the:

1. [voiced palatal nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_palatal_nasal) /ɲ/
2. [voiced labial-palatal approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labial%E2%80%93palatal_approximant) /ɥ/
3. [Uvular r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttural_R) /ʁ/
   * with four different [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone), but the [voiced uvular fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_uvular_fricative) is the most common in Paris. See [this video](https://youtu.be/hI2Pso1dDjM?t=728) for a demonstration of the four allophones.

Additionally, there are slight changes to p, k, t, and l.

In French, voiceless stops /p, t, k/ are unaspirated.

Also in French, /l/ brings only the front of the tongue to the roof of the mouth whereas in English the front and back of the tongue are brought to the roof of the mouth.

## Spelling Rules

1. Most final consonants are silent except for the consonants in "careful" (C-R-F-L).
2. Rule of [liasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_(French)) - certain silent final consonants are pronunced based on rules such as grammar.
3. Hard and soft c, g, sc
   * Use hard pronunciation when followed by *a*, *o*, *u*, or another consonant.
   * Use soft pronunciation when followed by *i*, *e*, or *y*.
4. Normally 'n' and 'm' are silent and indicate nasal vowels, but 'n' and 'm' sounds occur in two scenarios:
   1. when 'n' and 'm' are before vowels (such as animal) 
   2. or when two 'n's or 'm's occur in a row (such as anniversaire)
